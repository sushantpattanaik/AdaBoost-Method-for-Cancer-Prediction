# AdaBoost-Method-for-Cancer-Prediction
In this lab, youâ€™ll explore the breast cancer dataset and try to train the model to predict if the person is having breast cancer or not. We will start off with a weak learner, a decision tree with maximum depth = 2.  We will then build an adaboost ensemble with 50 trees with a step of 3 and compare the performance with the weak learner.
